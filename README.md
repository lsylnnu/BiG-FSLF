The code in this repository implements the "BiG-FSLF: A Cross Heterogeneous Domain Few-Shot Learning Framework Based on Bidirectional Generation for Hyperspectral Image Change Detection".

We run this code with python 3.8, torch==1.11.0, and CUDA==11.3.

Please kindly cite our paper if this code is useful and helpful for your research.

If you encounter any bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.

First, you need to run the script MSI157_matpickle.py to generate preprocessed source domain data.
Furthermore, if you want to use your own dataset, please note that the label information of changed class and unchanged class in the ground-truth data of the source domain and target domain should be consistent.
